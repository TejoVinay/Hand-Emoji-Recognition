## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Hand gesture recognition is an essential task in computer vision that involves interpreting human hand movements to perform specific actions. This project showcases the development of a hand gesture detection system using deep learning techniques. The system is capable of identifying a predefined set of hand gestures and associating them with corresponding actions.
